<font size="4">Hello, my name is Yujia Li, a Ph.D Candidate in Biostatisitics at the Department of Biostatistics of the School of Public Health at University of Pittsburgh. I received my Bachelor of Science degree of Applied Mathematics and a minor certificate of Mathematical Finance at Xiamen University. My research focuses on developing novel statistical methods in statistical machine learning, Bayesian analysis, high-dimensional variable selection, Analysis of Multi-Omics Data (Genomics, Transcriptomics, Epigenetics, etc). In addition to research, I like playing tennis, badminton as well as swimming.</font>
